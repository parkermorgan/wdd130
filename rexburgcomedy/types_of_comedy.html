                <p class = "maininfo">Rexburg Comedy has multiple opportunities for those who want to learn more about the art of comedy. Our primary focus is on improvisational comedy. Improvisational comedy, or improv for short, is a form where comedic scenes are thought of completely on the spot. Ideas and suggestions are taken from audience members and are then performed by the players. Rather than a script or sketch, improv is played through a variety of different “games”. These games are split into multiple different categories, ranging from games where a player must guess something that is unknown to them through hints from other players to musical games where players must sing a made-up song on the spot with accompaniment.</p>

                    Sketch comedy is an exhilarating form of entertainment that combines quick wit, creativity, and humor in front of a live audience. In these performances, actors bring scripted or improvised sketches to life, often tackling a wide range of topics from everyday life to current events with a comedic twist. Workshops for live sketch comedy provide a platform for aspiring comedians and writers to hone their skills, offering instruction on character development, joke writing, and stage presence. Whether you're looking to try your hand at comedy or simply enjoy a good laugh, live sketch comedy workshops offer a fun and supportive environment to explore the craft of comedy.

                <p class = "maininfo">Stand-up comedy is an electrifying art form that revolves around a single performer standing on stage, armed with nothing but a microphone and their wit, aiming to make audiences laugh uproariously. In this raw and unfiltered medium, comedians deliver a barrage of jokes, anecdotes, and observations drawn from their own experiences and observations of the world around them. From dissecting everyday absurdities to tackling taboo topics with fearless honesty, stand-up comedy pushes the boundaries of humor while offering profound insights into the human condition.

                    Workshops dedicated to stand-up comedy provide a nurturing environment for aspiring comics to cultivate their comedic voice and sharpen their stage presence. Through constructive feedback, exercises in joke writing, and opportunities for live performance, these workshops empower individuals to craft compelling sets and develop the confidence to command the stage.  </p>
