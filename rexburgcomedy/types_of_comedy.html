                <p class = "maininfo">Rexburg Comedy has multiple opportunities for those who want to learn more about the art of comedy. Our primary focus is on improvisational comedy. Improvisational comedy, or improv for short, is a form where comedic scenes are thought of completely on the spot. Ideas and suggestions are taken from audience members and are then performed by the players. Rather than a script or sketch, improv is played through a variety of different “games”. These games are split into multiple different categories, ranging from games where a player must guess something that is unknown to them through hints from other players to musical games where players must sing a made-up song on the spot with accompaniment.</p>

                    Sketch comedy is an exhilarating form of entertainment that combines quick wit, creativity, and humor in front of a live audience. In these performances, actors bring scripted or improvised sketches to life, often tackling a wide range of topics from everyday life to current events with a comedic twist. Workshops for live sketch comedy provide a platform for aspiring comedians and writers to hone their skills, offering instruction on character development, joke writing, and stage presence. Whether you're looking to try your hand at comedy or simply enjoy a good laugh, live sketch comedy workshops offer a fun and supportive environment to explore the craft of comedy.

                <p class = "maininfo"> Standup comedy is our third and final form of comedy we teach. Most people are familiar with standup comedy, it has been a staple of comedy both live and televised over the years. It consists of one performer on stage performing a pre-written “set” consisting of jokes and stories. It is a form of comedy that is reliant on the sole performer, but our workshops are a useful tool in learning techniques on how to better write and perform a standup set. </p>
