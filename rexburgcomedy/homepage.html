            <p class = "maininfo_home">Rexburg Comedy is an organization that strives to bring laughter to the people of Rexburg, Idaho. We offer weekly improvisational workshops and have future plans to host sketch comedy and standup comedy workshops as well. Through these workshops, we hope to teach how to be better comedians and entertainers through various types of comedy. This website would be very helpful for the organization, as it is very hard to get new information out to the public at the moment, having information only spread through word of mouth. Having a website where that information is widely available and can be updated regularly would be a strong asset to the organization. 
            Our goal is to provide as many opportunities as possible for members of the community to learn about different forms of comedy, as well as be in a performing group that will perform for the public. There are currently no opportunities in the community to learn different forms of comedy, we are striving to remedy that issue. There is always a need for entertainment and laughter, especially in a small town without much to do. We hope that not only will this website be able to keep people up to date, but will also help answer any questions regarding events, and give relevant information to answer those questions. </p>
