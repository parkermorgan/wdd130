      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>. The purpose of the website is to be informative, having separate pages about each division of comedy, sketch comedy, improvisational comedy, and standup comedy. The website would have a page for contact information, as well as the organization's history and plans. It would also have announcements for upcoming events. This website would help members of the community learn more about Rexburg Comedy and have a central hub for anyone to be able to find information about the organization.  If someone was to ask, “is there any performing arts in Rexburg?" This would be the place for them to go and learn!</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Overview:
        Rexburg Comedy is an organization that strives to bring laughter to the people of Rexburg, Idaho. We offer weekly improvisational workshops and have future plans to host sketch comedy and standup comedy workshops as well. Through these workshops, we hope to teach how to be better comedians and entertainers through various types of comedy. This website would be very helpful for the organization, as it is very hard to get new information out to the public at the moment, having information only spread through word of mouth. Having a website where that information is widely available and can be updated regularly would be a strong asset to the organization. 
        Our goal is to provide as many opportunities as possible for members of the community to learn about different forms of comedy, as well as be in a performing group that will perform for the public. There are currently no opportunities in the community to learn different forms of comedy, we are striving to remedy that issue. There is always a need for entertainment and laughter, especially in a small town without much to do. We hope that not only will this website be able to keep people up to date, but will also help answer any questions regarding events, and give relevant information to answer those questions.

      <h3>Types of Comedy</h3>
      <p>
        Rexburg Comedy has multiple opportunities for those who want to learn more about the art of comedy. Our primary focus is on improvisational comedy. Improvisational comedy, or improv for short, is a form where comedic scenes are thought of completely on the spot. Ideas and suggestions are taken from audience members and are then performed by the players. Rather than a script or sketch, improv is played through a variety of different “games”. These games are split into multiple different categories, ranging from games where a player must guess something that is unknown to them through hints from other players to musical games where players must sing a made-up song on the spot with accompaniment.
        Sketch comedy is another form that we strive to teach and perform. Unlike improv, sketch comedy is written by a group of writers, then performed by players. Sketch comedy is like the likes of ‘Studio C’ and ‘Saturday Night Live.’  It requires regular rehearsing and staging. Sketch comedy utilizes sets, props, and costumes, all of which are not common in improv or standup comedy.
        Standup comedy is our third and final form of comedy we teach. Most people are familiar with standup comedy, it has been a staple of comedy both live and televised over the years. It consists of one performer on stage performing a pre-written “set” consisting of jokes and stories. It is a form of comedy that is reliant on the sole performer, but our workshops are a useful tool in learning techniques on how to better write and perform a standup set.
